# Municipal-Public-Records-systems
 Public records systems for Municipalities

 Project Concept
___________________________

The idea of this project is to build a web-based platform for local authorities 
where the public will be able to get public records and achievable information.

The range of data that I attempt to store are:

1. Death and Burial records
2. Marriages
3. Pet/dog registrations
4. Land records

Scope.

- Design an interface that will interact with the various databases to provide search capabilities.
-Log in and security interface to user-restricted data
