Abstract
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
For nearly 20 years, the Zambian government has actively pursued the national decentralization policy, aiming to bring government services and functions closer to its citizens and ensure accessibility for all. Central to this effort are Local Authorities (Councils), which serve as the primary link between governance and grassroots communities. Recognizing the importance of digital transformation in enhancing citizen engagement, the policy emphasizes the creation and implementation of digital platforms for seamless government interaction.
In line with this vision, the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, charged with the mandate of overseeing Local Authorities, introduced a nationwide digital strategy. This initiative prioritizes developing and deploying digital solutions to improve access to government services.
To address the needs identified under this policy, my project proposal focuses on establishing the Municipal Public Records Information System (MPRIS). This web-based platform will provide citizens with access to various public records, such as marriage and death certificates, land and property details, and other essential information. Designed for user convenience, the system will feature an intuitive and organized interface, categorizing records for easy navigation and accessibility.


1. Death and Burial records
2. Marriages
3. Pet/dog registrations
4. Land records

Scope.

- Design an interface that will interact with the various databases to provide search capabilities.
-Log in and security interface to user-restricted data
